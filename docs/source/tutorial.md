Multiples of 3 or 5

Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

answer: 

def sum_of_multiples():
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1000):
        if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
            sum += i
    return sum

print(sum_of_multiples())

Even Fibonacci numbers

Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Largest prime factor

def sum_of_even_fibonacci():
    sum = 0
    a, b = 1, 2
    while b <= 4000000:
        if b % 2 == 0:
            sum += b
        a, b = b, a + b
    return sum

print(sum_of_even_fibonacci())

Problem 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
