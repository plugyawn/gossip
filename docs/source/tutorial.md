# Gossip Language Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will use the Gossip programming language to solve some of the problems from the first few Euler problems.

## Problem 1: Multiples of 3 or 5
`Problem`: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

`Solution`:

```bash
declare sum = 0;
for x in range(0,1000) do {
    if x%5==0 || x%3==0 then assign sum = sum + x;
};
print(sum);
```

## Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers
`Problem`: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

`Solution`:

```bash
declare sum = 2; 
declare i = 1; 
declare j = 2; 
declare k = 0; 
while j<=1000000 && i<=1000000 do {
    i = i + j; 
    assign k = j; 
    assign j = i; 
    assign i = k; 
    if i%2==0 then assign sum = sum + i; 
    }; 
print(sum);
```
## Problem 3: Largest prime factor
`Problem`: The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

`Solution`:
```bash
declare n = 600851475143;
declare maxpr = 0;
while n%2==0 do {
assign maxpr = 2;
assign n = n/2;};

declare i = 3;
while i*i<=n do {
while n%i==0 do {
assign maxpr = i;
assign n = n/i;};
assign i = i+2;};

if n>2 then print(n); else print(maxpr);;
```
## Problem 4: Largest palindrome product
`Problem`: A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

`Solution`:

```bash
deffunct check(n){
declare m = 0; 
declare r = n;
declare q = 1; 
while r>0 do {
assign m = m*q+r%10; 
assign r = r - r%10; 
assign r = r/10; 
if q==1 then assign q = 10;}; 
functret(m);
};
declare n  = 3; 
declare m = 0; 
for i in range(100,999) do { 
for j in range(100,999) do {
declare prod = i*j;
declare a = callfun check(prod);;
if prod > m && prod == a then assign m = prod;};};
print(m); 
```
## Problem 5: Smallest multiple
`Problem`: 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

`Solution`:

```bash
declare prod = 1;
declare primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19];

declare prime_index = 0;
declare max_prime_index = 8;

while prime_index<max_prime_index do {
declare prime =primes[prime_index];
declare i = 20;

declare exp = -1;

while i>prime do {
declare count = 0;
declare x = i;

while x%prime==0 do{
    assign count = count +1;
    assign x = x/prime;
}

if count>exp then assign exp = count;

if i==prime then { declare y = 0; while y<exp do {assign prod = prod*prime; assign y = y+1;}}
assign i = i-1;

};


print(prod);
```
That concludes this tutorial on using Gossip to solve some of the Euler problems. We encourage you to try solving the remaining problems on your own.
