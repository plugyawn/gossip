# Gossip Language Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will use the Gossip programming language to solve some of the problems from the first few Euler problems.

## Problem 1: Multiples of 3 or 5
`Problem`: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

`Solution`:

```bash
declare sum = 0;
for x in range(0,1000) do {
    if x%5==0 || x%3==0 then assign sum = sum + x;
};
print(sum);
```

## Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers
`Problem`: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

`Solution`:

```bash
declare sum = 2; 
declare i = 1; 
declare j = 2; 
declare k = 0; 
while j<=1000000 && i<=1000000 do {
    assign i = i + j; 
    assign k = j; 
    assign j = i; 
    assign i = k; 
    if i%2==0 then assign sum = sum + i; 
}; 
print(sum);
```
## Problem 3: Largest prime factor
`Problem`: The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

`Solution`:
```bash
declare n = 600851475143;
declare maxpr = -1;

while n%2==0 do {
    assign maxpr = 2;
    assign n = n/2;
}

declare i = 3;

while i*i<=n do {
    while n%i==0 do {
        assign maxpr = i;
        assign n = n/i;
    }
    assign i = i+2;
}

if n>2 then print(n); else print(maxpr);
```
## Problem 4: Largest palindrome product
`Problem`: A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

`Solution`:

```bash
// TODO: Add solution
```
## Problem 5: Smallest multiple
`Problem`: 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

`Solution`:

```bash
// TODO: Add solution
```
That concludes this tutorial on using Gossip to solve some of the Euler problems. We encourage you to try solving the remaining problems on your own.
